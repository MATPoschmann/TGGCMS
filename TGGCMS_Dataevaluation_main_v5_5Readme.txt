The program handles TG-GC-MS obtained with an Perkin-Elmer instrument and the databridge export resulting in an .TXT files.
This program contains several sub routines to obtain single massspectra, chormatograms, chromatograms of single masses. 
It can as well create a list of interesting masses and noise-filter the data on the level of each single mass recorded.
The Program is tested and optimized on measurement data of decomposing glucose (400 Â°C) in argon atmosphere with 2 different mass-scanranges.
